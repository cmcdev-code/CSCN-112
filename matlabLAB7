Exercise #1 ... T11.2-2
Problem Presentation 
Given two equations with three unkowns and are sked to solve for "x" and "y" in terms of "a"
Creating the variables    
syms a x y 
equation1 =x +6*y==a;
equation2 =2*x-3*y==9;
Solving the system of equatoons and displaying the results
[X,ylabel]=solve(equation1,equation2,{x,y})


Exercise #2 ... Problem 11,12
Problem Presentation 
Determine all the local minima and local maaxima and all the inflection points where dy/dx of the following function:
Creating the variables 
clear,clc,close all
syms x
y=x^4-(28/3)*x^3+9*x^2-5;%creating the function
dydx=diff(y);%taking the first derivative 
dy2dx2=diff(dydx);%taking the 2nd derivative
Now that we have the sybolic derivatives we can solve for where the x value is = to 0 which will be the critical points of the function either it will achive a max min or an inflection point 
x_points=solve(dydx);
y_points=subs(y,x,x_points);
now that we have the points and the value of the points we can take the 2nd derivative that will tell what type of point it is if it is greater then 0 it is concave up and a min point if it is less then 0 it is concave down and a max
for k= 1:length(x_points)
    eval(k)=subs(dy2dx2,x,x_points(k));
    if double(eval(k))>0 
        outcomes(k)="local min";
    elseif double(eval(k))==0
        outcomes(k)="inflection point";
    else 
        outcomes(k)="local maxima";
    end
end
Now that all of our calculations are completed we can display the results 
for k=1:length(x_points)
    fprintf('\n A %s exists at x = %4.2f, y=%4.2f. \n\n' ...
        ,outcomes{1,k},double(x_points(k)),double(y_points(k)))
end
now to plot it so we can get an image of what the graph will look like 
fplot(y,[double(x_points(1))-1 double(x_points(length(x_points)))+1])
hold on 
for k=1:length(x_points)
    plot(x_points(k),y_points(k),'rp')
end

Exercise #3... Problem 11.20
Problem Presentation 
Here we have the case of a rocket launch where the fuel burns for a specified length of time and we are interested in knowing the velocity at the end of the fuel burn. We are given the functions that describes the acceleration (dv/dt) and mass as a function of time as fuel burns. 
The first step it to create the variables 
syms t T mo r b g to tf
Peroform calculations 
v_t= int((T/(mo*(1-r*t/b)))-g,to,tf);
v_b=double(subs(v_t,{T mo r b g to tf},{48000 2200 0.8 40 9.81 0 40}));
Now to output the results 
fprintf("\nThe rocket velocity at fuel burnout is v=%6.2f m/s. \n \n",v_b)
